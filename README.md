#  Comparative analysis of six programming languages based on three language evaluation criteria

For the required project in our 'Concepts of programming language' course we tested and analysed the performance of the following languages based on  **Readability, Writability and Reliability**: 

* C
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Javascript
* R

# Abstract
Since their inception, the development of
programming languages had mostly been geared towards
improving efficiency. However, in recent years, a lot of the
attention has shifted towards making the languages readable
and writable, while also improving reliability. These factors
affect how many new users start to use a particular language,
and how many experienced programmers continue to use it
reliably in real applications. Hence, in this research, we have
compared the readability, writability and reliability of six
mainstream programming languages based on their
characteristics. To verify the actuality of our findings, a survey
was done to see how programmers and non-programmers judge
the languages based on code snippets. Finally, experiments were
carried out to see if there is a relation between the efficiency of
a language and its readability, writability.


**Keywords** â€” programming languages, readability, writability,
reliability, efficiency.
